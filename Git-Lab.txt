Work with a partner on one of your computers. Download this text file and fill it out as
you go. When you're done, switch to the other partner's computer and do it again.

Use Terminal (on Mac) or Git Bash (on Windows) and your favorite text editor to complete
the following. Wherever you see a >>>, record what command you used to complete that step.
If you used multiple commands, write all the command you used.
Wherever you see a ???, write a short answer to the question.

1. Create a new folder
>>> mkdir git-lab

2. Make that folder into a local Git repository
>>> cd git-lab 
	git init

3. Add a new empty file called story.txt
>>> touch story.txt

4. Open that file in a text editor.
>>> (optional)  open story.txt

5. Add an opening paragraph to story.txt. Save it. The file should be at least several
lines long.

6. Create another file called authors.txt. Add your names to it and save it. touch authors.txt

7. Commit only story.txt, with commit message "Initial Commit".
>>> git commit -m “Initial Commit”

8. What is the status of story.txt and what is the status of authors.txt at this point?
??? story.txt: Comitted
??? authors.txt: Not tracked

9. Add a bit to your story in a text editor and save it. What is the status of story.txt now?
??? Tracked but unstaged

10. Stage story.txt for the next commit.
>>> git add story.txt

11. Stage authors.txt for the next commit.
>>> git add authors.txt

12. One second thought, unstage authors.txt. We don't want to commit it yet. 
>>> git reset HEAD authors.txt

13. Hmm. On third thought, yeah, let's stage it after all.
>>> git add authors.txt

14. Now commit both staged files. (message = "extended story and added authors")
>>> git commit -m “extended story and added authors”

15. Set up a GitHub repository and push this latest commit to that repo.
>>> git remote add origin https://github.com/jenniferdoig628/git-practice.git

	git push -u origin master

16. One of you make a change to one of the files while the other is not looking. Don't
stage or commit.

17. The other of you use Git's command line tools to figure out what file is changed and
what is changed about it. (You must use at least two different commands in your
investigation.)
>>>   git status
>>>  open story.txt

18. Now undo the change that was made.
>>> git checkout story.txt

19. Add a bogus author. Save and stage.
>>> git open author.txt (change)
	git add author.txt

20. Can you use git tools to see that change?
>>>  open author.txt

21. Nevermind that. Now completely undo that change so that you're back to the real
authors from the last commit.
>>> git checkout authors.txt

22. Add another couple sentences to your story and commit.
>>> open story.txt 
Git add story.txt
Git commit  -m “added more to story” 

23. Delete authors.txt and commit that.
>>> git rm —cached author.txt
Git commit -m “deleted author.txt”

24. List all the commits.
>>>

25. You're reminiscing about the good 'ol days of seeing your names in text. Switch back
